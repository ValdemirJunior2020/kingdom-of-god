      <p>
        The Gospel of the Kingdom is the powerful message that <strong>Jesus is King</strong> and His Kingdom has come near. 
        It’s not just about going to heaven when we die — it’s about heaven invading earth through Jesus now.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4">📖 What Did Jesus Preach?</h3>
      <p>
        From the beginning of His ministry, Jesus said:
        <br />
        <em>“Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.”</em> (Matthew 4:17)
      </p>

      <p>
        He healed the sick, cast out demons, forgave sins, and taught with authority — all as signs that the Kingdom of God was breaking into the world.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4">🌍 What Is the Kingdom?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>God's reign through Jesus</li>
        <li>His will being done on earth as it is in heaven</li>
        <li>A call to live as citizens of heaven now</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="mt-4">✝️ The Cross & Resurrection</h3>
      <p>
        Through His death and resurrection, Jesus defeated sin, death, and Satan. He rose as the victorious King, and now calls us into His Kingdom.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4">🚀 Our Response</h3>
      <p>
        The Kingdom is for those who repent, believe in Jesus, and follow Him as Lord. 
        We’re not just saved — we’re sent. We now live to reveal His Kingdom in the world.
      </p>
