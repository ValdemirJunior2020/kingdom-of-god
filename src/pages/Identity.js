      <p>
        When we are born again through Christ, we don’t just become believers — we become <strong>sons and daughters</strong> of the King.
        That means we carry Kingdom DNA, authority, and purpose.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4">👑 We Are Children of God</h3>
      <p>
        <em>"Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God."</em><br />
        — John 1:12
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4">⚔️ We Walk in Kingdom Authority</h3>
      <p>
        Jesus said: <em>"I have given you authority... to overcome all the power of the enemy."</em><br />
        — Luke 10:19
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>We are ambassadors of the Kingdom (2 Corinthians 5:20)</li>
        <li>We are temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19)</li>
        <li>We are seated with Christ in heavenly places (Ephesians 2:6)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="mt-4">🔥 We Manifest the Kingdom</h3>
      <p>
        As sons and daughters, we’re not called to just attend church — we’re called to bring heaven to earth. That includes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Healing the sick</li>
        <li>Preaching the Gospel</li>
        <li>Casting out demons</li>
        <li>Loving radically</li>
      </ul>
